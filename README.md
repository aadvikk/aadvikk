## Hey! I'm Aadvik 😁

A creative human trying to be creative with code ✨

I love discovering interesting datasets in the wild and breaking them down to uncover stories hidden inside numbers. If there's data, I'm probably already analyzing it.

### My Toolbox:
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Seaborn · Matplotlib · SQL  
Tableau · Google Colab · Excel · Google Docs (I *really* love documenting stuff)

### On This Profile:
I'm slowly uploading all the mini-projects and ideas living in my mind.  
Stick around — the list gets bigger day by day!

### When I'm not coding...
- I'm hanging out with my adorable dog 🐶  
- Watching Bollywood movies  
- Singing, playing guitar, or going down endless YouTube rabbit holes

Thanks for stopping by. ✨
